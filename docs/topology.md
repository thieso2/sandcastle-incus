# Sandcastle Topology — Architecture Overview

The domain vocabulary is in [`glossary.md`](glossary.md); the runnable end-to-end
proof is [`e2e-sc2.md`](e2e-sc2.md). This document ties the pieces together and
maps them onto the code.

Two principles run through everything:

- **No prebuilt images.** Every container and VM is created from stock upstream
  images (`images:debian/13`), pulled on demand. There is no `sandcastle/base`
  to build or pre-cache.
- **No inbound ports required.** The public Auth Hostname is fronted by an
  outbound Cloudflare tunnel by default (ACME on host `:80/:443` is opt-in); the
  tenant's Incus API and machines are reached over the tenant's tailnet. A host
  behind NAT can run a complete Sandcastle.

## The model

```
Tenant  (the ownership/identity/infra boundary; handle = GitHub username for
 │       login-provisioned tenants, or an admin-minted handle)
 │
 ├── sc2-<tenant>            Incus project = per-tenant infra
 │     └── one sidecar: CoreDNS + Tailscale subnet-router (+ Incus Reach proxy)
 │
 ├── sc2-<tenant>            bridge (in the `default` Incus project)  ← one shared
 │                           network for all the tenant's projects (10.x.y.0/24)
 │
 ├── sc2-<tenant>-default    Incus project (features.networks=false → shared bridge)
 │     ├── default profile = shared /home + /workspace volumes + cloud-init login
 │     └── machines: dev, web, …   → resolve flat as  dev.<tenant> , web.<tenant>
 │
 └── sc2-<tenant>-<project>  Incus project   (a second project; same shape)
       └── machines: dev1, …          → dev1.<tenant>
```

- **Boundary = Tenant.** Access (a restricted, project-scoped Incus TLS cert),
  DNS, tailnet, storage, and the OIDC issuer are all scoped to the tenant.
- **Project = its own Incus project** (`sc2-<tenant>-<project>`). Machines are
  freeform `incus` instances with native names — `dev` in two projects coexist.
  Each project carries its own shared `/home` + `/workspace` volumes and the
  tenant's login profile.
- **One shared network per tenant** (`sc2-<tenant>` bridge in `default`);
  projects are not network-isolated from each other (single owner).
- **Per-tenant tailnet, subnet-router sidecar.** Machines are **not** tailnet
  nodes; they sit on the bridge (`10.x`) and are reached over the tenant's
  tailnet via the sidecar's advertised `/24` subnet route. The tenant brings
  their own Tailscale key (or joins the sidecar interactively at login).
- **Flat DNS: `<machine>.<suffix>`.** One CoreDNS zone per tenant; a background
  reconciler in the Auth App registers every running machine automatically.

## Native `incus`, brokered lifecycle

The tenant's primary interface is the vanilla `incus` client over their
restricted cert — enrolled by `sc login` (or `sc enroll` from a token), pointed
at the sidecar's tailnet IP (the **Incus Reach**: the sidecar proxies the host's
Incus API onto the tenant tailnet, so the host cert is pinned end-to-end). The
`sc` CLI wraps this: `sc c <machine>`, `sc list`, `sc create --vm`, and the
lifecycle commands operate on freeform instances.

Project **lifecycle** (create/delete) is privileged, so it goes through the
**Sandcastle Broker** appliance: `sc project create <name> --broker …` is
authorized by the tenant's restricted cert, and the broker does the scaffolding
(new Incus project + bridge wiring + profile + volumes) and extends the tenant's
certificate to cover it.

## The appliances

All three are stock-image system containers with the one fat binary copied in,
deployed in one command by `sc-adm install`:

| Appliance | Role |
|---|---|
| **Auth App** (`sc2-auth-app`) | GitHub OAuth login + device login; provisions tenants; the OIDC provider for workload identity; the DNS auto-registration reconciler. Terminates its own public hostname (embedded caddy; optional cloudflared for tunnel mode) — no separate edge appliance. |
| **Broker** (`sc2-broker`) | Authorizes and performs tenant + project lifecycle over the host Incus socket. |
| **Sidecar** (`sc2-<tenant>`) | Per tenant: CoreDNS (the tenant zone) + Tailscale subnet-router + the Incus Reach proxy. |

## Public ingress

The Auth App appliance terminates its own public hostname (`--ingress`):

- **cloudflare** — `cloudflared` dials out to a Cloudflare tunnel; no inbound
  ports. The installer can create the tunnel + DNS itself (`--cloudflare-api-token`)
  or use a dashboard-made tunnel token.
- **acme** — caddy binds the host's `:80/:443` and gets a real Let's Encrypt
  certificate (needs a public IP + an A record).
- **none** — bring your own edge.

Tenant apps get public HTTPS the same way (a vhost on the same caddy, or a
tunnel host), reaching the machine's bridge IP directly since the host routes
between `incusbr0` and the tenant bridge.

## Open / deferred

- **Multi-host clusters:** the shared edge reaching tenant bridges relies on
  single-host routing. Revisit for clustering.
- **Split-DNS over tailscale:** serving the tenant zone to tailnet clients on the
  sidecar's tailnet IP (so `ssh dev.<tenant>` resolves client-side) is future work.
- **Per-tenant CA / private HTTPS:** the tenant-CA leaf path (for `sc trust
  install`) is not yet issued; the public ingress path needs no CA install.
