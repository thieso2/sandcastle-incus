// glob, in which case the command runs once per matching enrolled install.

// A remote pattern is matched against ENROLLED SANDCASTLE REMOTE NAMES (what
// `sc remote list` shows) — not against every incus remote, so `*` never
// wanders into `images:` or `local:`, and not against install DNS suffixes,
// which cannot be enumerated without connecting to each install first.
//
// Scopes are entered SEQUENTIALLY. Binding a config to an install re-points the
// process-wide INCUS_CONF for the duration (that is how the incus client
// finds the right restricted certificate), so two installs cannot be in scope
// at once. Within one install the per-project and per-machine work still fans
// out concurrently, which is where the round trips actually are.

// returns the func that unbinds it. Injected so the fan-out is testable
